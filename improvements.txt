1. A generic CSV parser could be implemented. General idea
*	Each attribute/property in the model class could have a data notation similar to:
	[CsvParser(ColumnName="Price", Type=typeof(decimal)]
	public decimal Price { get; set; }
*	Customs parse would be a case apart but for most of it would be supported
