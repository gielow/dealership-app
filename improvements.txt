1. A generic CSV parser could be implemented. General idea
*	Each attribute/property in the model class could have a data notation similar to:
	[CsvParser(ColumnName="Price", Type=typeof(decimal)]
	public decimal Price { get; set; }
*	Customs parse would be a case apart but for most of it would be supported

2. The CSV file is passed during startup. A configuration or abstraction would be nicer, 
maybe providing a configuration/CSV file provider or path.

3. Host a RESTful API and add it's address to the main.ts that can be injected and used in every component.
